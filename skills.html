			<h2>Determination, perseverance and resolve.</h2>
			<p>As a black belt in the art of procrastination it was very easy for me to give up on something when it
				was not quite going to plan. It is perfectly okay to struggle with some things more than others, but it
				is not okay to completely ignore the more challenging tasks. This is a really important skill to have
				in any work place, or even at school. Revision, essays, university applications and personal statements
				all have deadlines and the more practice you have at working quickly while maintaining standards, the
				better

			<h2>Learning from mistakes</h2>
			<p>Everyone makes mistakes. It is a fact of life. So why do we get so caught up in regret and embarrassment
				when we make one? One of the most important things I’ve learned over my time is that
				it’s okay to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them. Now I know we get told this all the time,
				but it has never truly sunk in for me until now. If you make a spelling mistake, you don’t know how to
				send an email, or you spill something, it is okay! The chances are you won’t make that same mistake
				again.</p>

			<h2>Communication</h2>
			<p>One thing everybody needs to be able to do is communicate, whether you’re discussing a brief, writing an
				article, or conducting an interview or discussion an issue with your professor. One of the goals I set
				myself before the start of everythong is to reduce my anxiety when talking to strangers. I truly believe
				that this experience has helped me to develop my communication
				skills. I can speak clearly, thoughtfully and without feeling nervous.</p>

			<h2>Learn to serve and serve to learn</h2>
			<p>Do what you are doing and give it your very best. Whether it's business or washing dishes, or the
				programming, or
				any field. If you don't love what you're doing and you can't give it your best, get out of it. Life is
				too short. You'll be an old person before you know it.

			<h2>Html-css-Javascript-Php-ReactJs</h2>
			<p>I use them all. Programming language is a tool using which people design working programs. Correct,
				understandable and
				fast programs, in order of priority. I use a specific language that is best suited for a specific task.
